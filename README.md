Create a landing page with HTML and CSS
- My motivation for this project is to create a successful landing page to better understand CSS and HTML.
- I built this project to learn and increase my knowledge.
- This landing page will solve the need for people that want to contact me.
- I learned that you can add a border-radious to create a box around your text. I learned how to create a button and also the copyright symbol. I also learned that adding an h ref with the section tag and adding that id to the section desired will link them.
